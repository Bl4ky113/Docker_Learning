## What is Docker, and Why?

Docker is a Plataform for Dev, Ship and Run Apps on our Infrastructure, so we can ship it to production more quickly.
They offer ways to shipping, testing and deploying code more quickly.

Docker Works on Containers of Code, these can be used from a host easily, beeing light and just what you need to 
run your app. These can be conected to others containers, which form a orchestated service. 

Using Docker, we can push and code more quickly, by just pushing a Docker Container Image to 
Production, making the process way faster.
Thanks to its lightweight implementation, we can scale our docker containers easily.
And the very same lightweight capability, help us by reducing power, processing and
general using less resources.

Docker Works by mainly a daemon which, is the one who mantains the docker app. By taking from a 
registry, an image, which is a template for a container, where after creating one, we are going to 
use our app. This can be made by using different docker customization files in our project.
